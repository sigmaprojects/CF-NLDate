Simple natrual language parser for past dates.
Parses string likes "yesterday", "two days ago", "last week", "last month", etc and returns a date object

4/16/14: Good news!  Partial support for future dates.  Things like "In an hour" "In 5 days".

TODO:
	- Better support for future days, i.e. "In a *few* hours*"
	- Others, I'm sure.
